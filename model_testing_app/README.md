# Model Testing App

This app is for testing backend REST API endpoints (especially `/api/chat`) and diagnosing model performance issues (e.g., slow response from Qwen3:0.6b).

## Features
- Test backend chat endpoint with various prompts
- Measure response time and log slow cases
- Analyze prompt quality and suggest improvements
- Easy to extend for other endpoints

## Usage
- Run the test script to send requests to your backend
- Review logs for slow responses and prompt issues
- Use results to optimize backend and prompt design

## Next Steps
- Add test script for `/api/chat`
- Log response time and errors
- Add prompt improvement suggestions
