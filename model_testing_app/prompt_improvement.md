# Prompt Improvement Guide

## Why Prompts Matter
A well-crafted prompt can make your AI model respond faster and more accurately. Poor prompts may cause longer inference times and less relevant answers.

## Tips to Improve Prompts
- Be clear and specific about your request
- Avoid unnecessary context or overly long instructions
- Use direct questions or commands
- Limit the use of ambiguous or open-ended phrases
- For technical queries, provide concise background
- For creative tasks, set boundaries (e.g., "Write a story in 3 sentences")

## Example
**Slow Prompt:**
> Can you please, if possible, summarize everything you know about artificial intelligence, including its history, current trends, and future predictions?

**Improved Prompt:**
> Summarize the current trends in artificial intelligence.
